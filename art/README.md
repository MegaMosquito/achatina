# art

I like to use Apple's KeyNote program to edit my diagrams, and to create the achatina logo. The `achatina.key` file in thei directory is the KeyNote document I used for that. I hid it down here so it would not suggest to anyone that it was a crypto key file or something similar.

Also, I know I'm an engineer, not an artist. More artistic contributions would be welcome. :-)
